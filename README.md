 - Rationale: Arial offers a balanced and professional appearance, ensuring that content is    easily readable across various devices and screen sizes.

2. Color Scheme: 
 - Choice: Adopted a minimalist color scheme with shades of blue (#007bff) and green (#    4CAF50).
  - Rationale: These colors are not only visually appealing but also evoke feelings of trustworthiness and growth, aligning with the branding of a fictitious professional service.

    - Rationale: Hover effects add interactivity and responsiveness, while toggles allow users to quickly access additional information, improving user experience and engagement.
